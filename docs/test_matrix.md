## Running Tests

### Automated (Recommended)

```powershell
# Windows - Full automation with dashboard
.\fusion.bat

# Linux/WSL
./fusion.sh
```

Dashboard shows live test results at http://localhost:8000.

### Manual Verification

```powershell
# Rust
cargo test

# Python
pytest tests/

# C++
cmake --build build --config Release
.\build\Release\cpp_test.exe
82: 
83: # JS/TS
84: cd src/js && npm test

```

## Coverage Reports

After a test run, coverage reports are available in `logs/latest/coverage/`:

| Language | Report Path | Tool |
|----------|-------------|------|
| Rust | `coverage/rust/index.html` | `cargo-llvm-cov` |
| Python | `coverage/python/index.html` | `coverage.py` |
| C++ (Windows) | `coverage/cpp/index.html` | `OpenCppCoverage` |
| C++ (Linux) | `coverage/cpp/index.html` | `lcov` / `genhtml` |
| JS/TS | `coverage/js/index.html` | `c8` (Planned) |


> **CI/CD Pipeline:** See [Architecture - Automation Pipeline](architecture.md#automation--cicd-pipeline)
